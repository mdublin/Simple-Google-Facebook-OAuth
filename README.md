For Google OAuth:

You need to visit the Google Cloud Platform, and register an app or create a project, and grab the credentials from the API Manager (the Server key and Web client OAuth 2.0 client ID)

Download the client_secret.json file from the OAuth 2.0 client IDs section. 

Add the client ID to the JS in the clientOAuth.html view.
